Just relax, concentrate. Vim commands are strange and powerful and may leave you momentarily frustrated.  If you can get back to NORMAL mode, you can use the undo command(u) to get you back to a place you feel comfortable.

Take Deep Breathes and repeat:
ESC u
ESC u
ESC u
ESC u

Modes - 
you start in NORMAL mode

i - enter INSERT mode
ESC - enter NORMAL mode.

v - enter VISUAL mode
ESC - enter NORMAL mode.

: - enter COMMAND mode
ESC - enter NORMAL mode.

Helpful navigation commands - 
hjkl - function like arrow keys
0 - returns you to the beginning of the line.
gg - returns you to the beginning of the file.
{ and } - navigate down and up to the next blank line.

Start each excersize below by navigating to the start of the line(0) you would like to edit.

Save early, save often.  Use the write command in command mode to save this file (:write or :w)

********** USE VISUAL MODE TO DELETE A WORD **********
11. Delete the unnecessary word by using the v command to enter VISUAL mode, using home row keys (hjkl) to expand the selection, and the d command to delete.

12. Use the change(c) command to enter INSERT mode after using VISUAL mode to replace a word.

********** USE YANK AND PASTE TO COPY AND PASTE **********

"Aren't you a little short for a ?"

SHOULD BE:
"You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on 12 systems."

18. Use the substitute command again to substitute all x with s.  You need to use the global modifier (g) after your command. :s/x/s/g

"Thexe blaxt pointx - too accurate for xandpeople. Only imperial xtormtrooperx are xo precixe."
SHOULD BE:

********** REPLACE **********
20. The replace(r) command in NORMAL mode allows you to replace a single character.  Replace the 6 below with r5.
"This is Red 6, I'm going in."
SHOULD BE:
"This is Red 5, I'm going in."

********** FILE NAVIGATION **********
21. Save this file as a different name using the write(:w) command.
* Use the edit(:e .) command in command mode with an argument of '.' to enter the file system.
* Navigate the file system with the same navigation commands we've learned earlier (hjkl, etc) and choose a file with return.

22. Use the list comannd (:ls) to list all the open buffers.  A buffer is a file that you have previously opened.
* Choose the original file by using the buffer command (:b <number>) with the number you saw listed with :ls
* Choose a different file from the buffer list by name, (:b <name_of_file>).

23. There are a couple of special commands in NORMAL mode to move to previous files or locations.
* ctrl-o will move you back in the jump list
* ctrl-i will move you forward in the jump list
* ctrl-6 will open the previous file you had open.

24. When you opened vim, the directory you opened from will be the parent directory.  To see that directory use the current dir(:pwd) command in command mode.

25. Open a file with the edit command (:e <path to file>)

********** COMPOSABLE COMMANDS AKA MOTIONS **********

All the commands learned above(plus more!) can be composed to create shorter and quicker edits.

26. Edit the following by using a delete command combined with the find command (dfX)

"Here is a bunch of text that doesn't belongXHe's the brains, sweetheart!"
SHOULD BE:
"He's the brains, sweetheart!"

27. We can try the same thing but combine the delete command with the 0 command (d0).  You're cursor should be to the right of the X for this.
"Here is a bunch of text that doesn't belongXHe's the brains, sweetheart!"
SHOULD BE:
"He's the brains, sweetheart!"

********** AUTOCOMPLETION **********
28. Use ctrl-n in insert mode to complete words or list possible completions.  For instance typing: Imp<ctrl-n> will autocomplete Imperial for you.
"I'm a member of the Senate on a mission to Alderaan."
SHOULD BE:
"I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan."
